# Pyhton-translator-script-uses-google-api-
Please note that you need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Google Translate API key. Also, the target_language variable is used to specify the language you want to translate the text to, using the 2 letter language code, for example "fr" for French, "es" for Spanish, etc.

Also, make sure you have the requests library installed in your environment. If not, you can install it by running !pip install requests in your terminal or command prompt.

This script will print out the translated text in French.
